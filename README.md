Experiment 1:-
(i)Observe the time gaps between your next 30 WhatsApp
messages. (You may replace WhatsApp with any instant
messaging app of your choice.)
(ii)Plot a histogram of your data using Matlab.
(iii)Fit a density function on to your histogram, by using the
appropriate Matlab tools.
(iv)Based on your distribution, find the probability that the time
elapsed until your next message is less than the expected time
gap.

Experiment 2:-
Repeat Experiment 1, but this time, record the time gaps between
messages from one person - a person you communicate with
sufficiently often.

Do the following for both experiments:
Observe the time gaps between the next 10 messages you
receive. If a time gap is less than the expected time gap, mark
the observation as a Heads, otherwise as Tails.
Record the number of Heads and Tails.
